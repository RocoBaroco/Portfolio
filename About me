Hello, I'm Rositsa and I want to be a Junior Manual QA. I'm organized, strict, with attention to detail and I like to do something right. In my work, 
I always try to "put myself" in the client's shoes first. Otherwise, how could we help each other more easily? I've always worked with people and
I'm not worried about working in a tense or relaxed environment. I adjust according to the conditions and fit in great.I am a calm and balanced person, 
I know how to take responsibility and learn from my mistakes. I like to develop and gain knowledge and experience, a person learns while he is alive. I like to cook
and photograph landscapes or events. I decided to deal with QA a year ago, 
I enrolled in the Softuni Software University and that's how my path began.At this stage of my studies I have reached Manual QA, I would like to work and then continue
as Automation QA.
